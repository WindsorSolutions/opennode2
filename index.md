OpenNode2 (ON2) is the free, tried-and-true choice for your next generation
Exchange Network Node. It is used at over 30 agencies of all sizes and is the
trusted choice for automating data exchange either state-to-state or with the
[EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX)](https://cdx.epa.gov/). OpenNode2 comes
pre-packaged with a variety of plugins for the commons data flows. It is
available for deployment in either a .Net or Java environment.
